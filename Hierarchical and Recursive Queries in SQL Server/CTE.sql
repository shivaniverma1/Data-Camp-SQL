-- A CTE
-- for IT-positions
-- To practice writing CTEs, let's start with a simple example. You will use the employee table which is built up of fields such as ID, Name, and Position. The task for you is to create a CTE called ITjobs (keep in mind the syntax WITH CTE_Name As) that finds employees named Andrea whose job titles start with IT. Finally, a new query will retrieve all IT positions and names from the ITJobs CTE.

-- To search for a pattern, you have to use the LIKE statement and % representing the search direction. For example, using a WHERE statement with LIKE 'N%' will find patterns starting with N.

-- Define the CTE ITjobs by the WITH operator
WITH
    ITjobs (ID, Name, Position)
    AS
    (
        SELECT
            ID,
            Name,
            Position
        FROM employee
        -- Find IT jobs and names starting with A
        WHERE Position LIKE 'IT%' AND Name LIKE 'A%'
    )

SELECT *
FROM ITjobs;

-- A CTE for high-paid IT-positions
-- In the previous exercise, you created a CTE to find IT positions. Now, you will combine these results with another CTE on the salary table. You will use multiple CTE definitions in a single query. Notice that a comma is used to separate the CTE query definitions. The salary table contains some more information about the ID and salary of employees. Your task is to create a second CTE named ITsalary and JOIN both CTE tables on the employees ID. The JOIN should select only records having matching values in both tables. Finally, the task is to find only employees earning more than 3000.
WITH
    ITjobs (ID, Name, Position)
    AS
    (
        SELECT
            ID,
            Name,
            Position
        FROM employee
        WHERE Position like 'IT%'
    ),

    -- Define the second CTE table ITSalary with the fields ID and Salary
    ITSalary (ID, Salary)
    AS
    (
        SELECT
            ID,
            Salary
        FROM Salary
        -- Find salaries above 3000
        WHERE Salary > 3000
    )

SELECT
    ITjobs.NAME,
    ITjobs.POSITION,
    ITsalary.Salary
FROM ITjobs
    -- Combine the two CTE tables the correct join variant
    INNER JOIN ITsalary
    -- Execute the join on the ID of the tables
    ON ITjobs.ID = ITsalary.ID;

--     Calculate the factorial of 5
-- A very important mathematical operation is the calculation of the factorial of a positive integer n. In general, the factorial operation is used in many areas of mathematics, notably in combinatorics, algebra, and mathematical analysis.

-- The factorial of n is defined by the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, the factorial of 3 (denoted by n!) is defined as:

-- 3! = 1 x 2 x 3 = 6

-- To calculate the factorial of n, many different solutions exist. In this exercise, you will determine the factorial of 5 iteratively with SQL.

-- Remember the syntax of a WHILE loop in SQL:

-- WHILE condition
-- BEGIN
--    {...statements...}
-- END;
-- More information on WHILE can be found in the documentation.

-- Define the target factorial number
DECLARE @target float = 5
-- Initialization of the factorial result
DECLARE @factorial float = 1

WHILE @target > 0 
BEGIN
    -- Calculate the factorial number
    SET @factorial = @factorial * @target
    -- Reduce the termination condition  
    SET @target = @target - 1
END

SELECT @factorial;

-- How
-- to query the factorial of 6 recursively
-- In the last exercise, you queried the factorial 5!
-- with an iterative solution. Now, you will calculate 6! recursively. We reduce the problem into smaller problems of the same type to define the factorial n! recursively. For this the following definition can be
-- used:

-- 0! = 1 for step = 0
-- (n+1)! = n! *
-- (step+1) for step > 0
-- With this simple definition you can calculate the factorial of every number. In this exercise, n! is represented by factorial.

-- You are going to leverage the definition above
-- with the help of a recursive CTE.

-- In this first exercise after the video, we will start

-- This means the task is to count from 1 to 50 using a recursive query. You have to

-- the CTE
-- with the definition of the anchor and recursive query and
-- set the appropriate
-- termination condition for the recursion
