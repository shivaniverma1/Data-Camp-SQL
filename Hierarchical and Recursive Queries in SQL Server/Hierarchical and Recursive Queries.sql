-- Create the alphabet recursively
-- The task of this exercise is to create the alphabet by using a recursive CTE.

-- To solve this task, you need to know that you can represent the letters from A to Z by a series of numbers from 65 to 90. Accordingly, A is represented by 65 and C by 67. The function char(number) can be used to convert a number its corresponding letter.

WITH
    alphabet
    AS
    (
                    SELECT
                -- Initialize letter to A
                65 AS number_of_letter
            -- Statement to combine the anchor and the recursive query
        UNION ALL
            SELECT
                -- Add 1 each iteration
                number_of_letter + 1
            -- Select from the defined CTE alphabet
            FROM alphabet
            -- Limit the alphabet to A-Z
            WHERE number_of_letter < 90
    )

SELECT char(number_of_letter)
FROM alphabet;

-- Create a time series of a year
-- The goal of this exercise is to create a series of days for a year. For this task you have to use the following two time/date functions:

-- GETDATE()
-- DATEADD(datepart, number, date)
-- With GETDATE() you get the current time (e.g. 2019-03-14 20:09:14) and with DATEADD(month, 1, GETDATE()) you get current date plus one month (e.g. 2019-04-14 20:09:14).

-- To get a series of days for a year you need 365 recursion steps. Therefore, increase the number of iterations by OPTION (MAXRECURSION n) where n represents the number of iterations.

WITH
    time_series
    AS
    (
                    SELECT

                DATEADD(day, 1, time)

            FROM time_series
            -- Limit the time series to 1 year minus 1 (365 days -1)
            WHERE time < GETDATE() + 364
    )

-- Who
-- is your manager?
-- In this exercise, we are going to
-- use the
-- dataset of an IT-organization which is provided in the table employee. The table has the fields ID
-- (ID number of the employee), Name
-- (the employee's name), and Supervisor (ID number of the supervisor).

-- The IT-organization consists of different roles and levels.

-- A section of the entire hierarchy

-- The organization has one IT director (ID=1, Heinz Griesser, Supervisor=0) with many subordinate employees. Under the IT director you can find the IT architecture manager (ID=10, Andreas Sternig, Supervisor=1) with three subordinate employees. For Andreas Sternig Supervisor=1 which is the IDof the IT-Director.

-- First, we want to answer the question: Who are the supervisors for each employee?

-- We are going to solve this problem by recursively querying the dataset.

-- Create the CTE employee_hierarchy

--     Get the hierarchy position
-- An important problem when dealing with recursion is tracking the level of recursion. In the IT organization, this means keeping track of the position in the hierarchy of each employee.

-- A section of the entire hierarchy

-- For this, you will use a LEVEL field which keeps track of the current recursion step. You have to introduce the field in the anchor member, and increment this value on each recursion step in the recursion member.

-- Keep in mind, the first hierarchy level is 0, the second levl is 1 and so on.

An example is CAST(ID AS VARCHAR(MAX)) to convert ID of type number to type char.
