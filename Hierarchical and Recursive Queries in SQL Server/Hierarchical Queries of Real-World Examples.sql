-- -- In this chapter, you will
-- -- practice your learnings about hierarchical and recursive querying on real-world problems, such as finding possible flight routes, assembling a car, and modeling a power grid.
-- Get all possible airports
-- The task of the next two exercises is to search for all possible flight routes. This means that, first, you have to find out all possible departure and destination airports from the table flightPlan.

-- In this exercise, you will create a CTE table named possible_Airports using the UNION syntax which will consist of all possible airports. One query of the UNION element selects the Departure airports and the second query selects the Arrival airports.

-- Previously, you looked at how the flight data is structured. You have already identified the necessary fields from the flightPlan table. These will be used in this exercise for the anchor and the recursive query.

-- The task of this exercise is to combine this knowledge to create a recursive query that:

-- gets all possible flights from Vienna
-- has a travel cost under 500 Euro
-- has fewer than 5 stops
-- You should output only the destinations and the corresponding costs!
